## Project Focus

### Core Python Concepts
- Variables, data types, and basic operators  
- File I/O, CSV handling, and Binary Files  
- Modules and packages, including `unittest` for testing  
- Type hints and docstrings for code clarity and documentation  
- Command-line arguments with `argparse`, `*args` & `**kwargs`  
- String formatting, escape characters, and regular expressions  
- Comprehensions, `map`, `filter`, `enumerate`  

### Advanced Python Features
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with classes, inheritance, and decorators  
- Generators and iterators for efficient data processing  
- Use of external libraries like NumPy and PIL for data manipulation and image handling  

### Algorithms & Data Structures
- Graph algorithms: BFS, DFS, Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm  
- Tree structures and traversals: preorder, postorder  
- Recursive functions and call stack concepts  
- Adjacency matrix and adjacency lists representation  
- Sorting algorithms like selection sort  
- Dynamic programming: tabulation, memoization, and problem-solving strategies
